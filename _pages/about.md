# 🙂 About Me
Hello! I'm Qihao, a second year master's student in the School of Computer Science at South China Normal Universty, advised by Professor [Tinyong Hao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gM77jOQAAAAJ) and supported by the [TAM Lab](https://tony-hao.github.io/TAMLab/index.html). 

My research interests include multimodal representation learning, natural language processing, multilingual lexical semantics, large language/vision-language models. See my Publications (mostly up to date) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=rNsndk0AAAAJ) page for papers and more information.

I am a travel enthusiast. In the past two years, I have been to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Changsha, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Wuhan, Chaohu, Huangshan, Chengdu, Dujiangyan, Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Tianjin, Beijing, Macau, Hong Kong, and Seoul. Traveling around the world is one of my dreams.

I am also one of the founders of LingX, an Empirical Linguistics Studio (语言学实证思辨坊) that aims to deliver consulting and methods related to quantitative linguistics and computational linguistics. The studio has designed and launched a course titled Text Mining and Python Programming and has organized online academic training sessions, attended by over 400 teachers and students from various universities. I am the principal instructor for the course.

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD opportunity for Fall 2025. I hope to further delve into research on practical multimodal applications, large multilingual/vision-language models.
